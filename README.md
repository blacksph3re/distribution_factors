This is an attempt to formalize the theorems in https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2412.16164 which derive common DC loadflow elements in a unified manner. If successful, this could serve as the starting point for other DC loadflow math proves as I will build up the DC loadflow equations from the ground up.
